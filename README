Send new Google Voice SMS messages as Prowl notifications to iPhone


This is a CLI script and requires the PHP class for Google Voice and Prowl. Edit 
config.php with your info and run the script. PHP needs to be compiled 
with Curl support. This script is a down and dirty solution so please 
no comments about efficiency or ugly code ;) Feel free to modify 
anything and redistribute for whatever use you see fit. If you make 
something cool, give me a shout!
